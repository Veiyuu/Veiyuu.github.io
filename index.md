I am a Criminal Justice major at CSUF solely for attending the school's ROTC program, I am taking this class for fun, and I am graduating in Spring 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, parts 1 and 2

    This lab was fun due because in part 1, my partner and I got to geek out about the history of unit conversion methods, and how stupid every system aside from metric is! Additionally, part 2 allowed us to emulate "game coding" to a degree, and so, I think it was fun coding around the concept of coding a cute little guessing game! As this was one of the earlier labs in play, and we were still new to using C++, learning syntax and all, we learnt a greatdeal about how variables, initialization, artihmetic operators, input, output, if statements, and relational operators functioned as was outlined in the lab's learning objective! We managed to practice doing all of that utilizing the conversion program, and the guessing game program!

* Lab 6, parts 1 and 2

    This lab was fun because the concept of coding a program to make us a sandwich was inherently funny! It was nice to joke around about how AI utilizing a sandwich creation program might take over our jobs as mindless McDonalds workers and such, I would know, I used to work there when I was younger! The Blackjack program was also fun, due to the inherent humor found in the context of the concept of gambling, haha, playing stupid games wins stupid prizes, am I right?!? Funny concept, the idea of winning money from a game statistically designed to make you lose money, VERY. Funny. Thought. The learning objectives for this lab, as outlined in the assignment's guidelines, were to further practice writing our own code that utilizes if statements. We were to utilize the std vector std string thingy, and to run command line arguments providing input to the program. I believe the lab overall accomplished all of those goals, with us practicing utilizing those concepts, as mentioned in the outline, very well! Good practice!

* Lab 10

    This was a particularly challenging lab for me, I recall! It was fun trying to remember and utilize everything we had learnt up to this point, applying them to this cute little County-population program! I remember it being very fun from the constructive discussions I had with my partner in regards to how to implemnent the code! It was mostly fun because of how challenging doing something seemingly so simple could be, just seperating the two units within the array! In any case, the outline had eseentially instrucited us to learn how to write code using 2D vectors, and to utilize unit tests prsumably to help us trace and debug our code; oof, debugging, my favorite! The last learning objective was to practice and internalize how to proficiently write funtion definitions! The lab had accomplished all of that, through our tireless execution and debugging!
